\begin{abstract}
In the process of realising a product, choices must be made about its configuration. For a digitally-controlled product, its programmed behaviour, or firmware, is an element which heavily influences user experience. We contrast three caricatures of practice in  which product configurations are either \emph{discovered}, \emph{decided} or \emph{designed}, and explore the role of  reflection, sketching and boundary objects as a foundation for the practice of design in firmware engineering. On this analysis, established practice for selecting programmed behaviour does not satisfy the criteria for being \emph{designed}. We examine what obstacles exist to applying reflective practices when selecting the \emph{behaviour} of products, and we propose a programme to identify artefacts and processes which can facilitate this work.

\section{Introduction}
% =============================================================================

A broad, inclusive definition of design, offered by Feng and Feenberg [], is "a process of consciously shaping an artifact to adapt it to specific goals and environments". 

However, not all shaping practices adopt a designerly world-view []. Some are close to a scientific method, where choices are \emph{discovered}, deducing them from facts. For example,  a material's physical properties can eliminate it from consideration, or experiments can recommend employing a particular approach over an alternative. Other practices map a space of solutions on many dimensions of assessment, so a configuration can be \emph{decided} based on an explicit or implicit scheme of values and preferences [].

}

So, is designing the same as discovering and decision-making? In this paper, we employ an exclusive definition of design, following Fallman[] and Louridas[], where the phrase \emph{designed} is reserved for preferences which are arrived at through reflective processes [Schon]. \emph{Designed} preferences are neither \emph{discovered} through evidence gathering, nor \emph{decided} through systematic analysis of a space of configurations. Instead, a designer engages in a "conversation with materials" [Schon], a dynamic process in which "the materials [designers] use begin to 'talk back'". [Ozenc et al]

Our position resonates strongly with Fallman's [], that sketching is "the archetypal activity of the design approach". If there are no candidate practices within firmware engineering which parallel \emph{sketching}, and if reflective techniques are central to value-creation in all design disciplines, we may ask whether product firmware is in fact designed at all?

In this paper We explore candidate materials to support reflective design within firmare engineering, considering approaches used within the field and comparing them to those from established design disciplines. We offer reasons why familiar approaches cannot be trivially transferred to firmware engineering. We then propose a number of candidates for reflective materials which may be used effectively in firmware design and describe a programme of experimentation to discover how those tools and approaches may sustain the co-design of product firmware.

\section{Firmware Design and Critiques}
% =============================================================================

Reports on established practice suggests the early phases of behaviour design for digitally-controlled products are centred on representations primarily accessible to programmers [Petre 2013]. Development begins with a software requirements document, and proceeds through software modelling constructs and program code until a single prototype implementation can be deployed [Ganssle 2000]. During these phases many choices are made which will impact on the interaction design embodied by the product. However, it is only after a working prototype is deployed that feedback is anticipated from end-users on the behaviour design choices already made [Punkka 2005, van der Helm 2008].

\section{Sketching, Ideation, Reflection, Archiving  }
% =============================================================================

In this paper, we explore behaviour blueprints as a design fiction and a rhetorical object. We outline the preferred features by analogy with effective tools from other disciplines, and we detail a program of future co-design experimentation which we hope will allow us to explore and validate candidate representations.

Van der Lugt [] observes how central ideation, reflection, storage, 

Many participants in a physical design process lack the skills needed to actually materialise the product. Nevertheless, sketches, blueprints and models can serve to catalyse knowledge exchange between a wide range of stakeholders, helping to integrate clients' experience of the market and users' experience of the domain from a very early stage in the design process of a physical product.

\section{Blueprints, Patterns, Collaboration and Co-design}
% =============================================================================

Blueprints of physical designs capture implementation commitments, guiding and constraining a specialist production process. However, they also stimulate and facilitate engagement with others without demanding they themselves have the skills to materialise the design. By contrast, in a firmware design process, the representations which characterise implementation commitments for code are accessible principally to programmers - those skilled in materialising digital behaviours - and can not effectively catalyse knowledge exchange with others. By excluding key stakeholders until working systems are ready to be tested, this restricts the design contributions they can make, and limits the potential for design thinking.

\begin{abstract}
In the process of realising a product, choices must be made about its configuration. For a digitally-controlled product, its programmed behaviour, or firmware, is an element which will heavily influence user experience. We contrast three caricatures of practice in  which product configurations either \emph{discovered}, \emph{decided} or \emph{designed}, and explore the role of  reflection, sketching and boundary objects as a foundation for the practice of design. On this analysis, established practice for selecting programmed behaviour does not satisfy the criteria for being \emph{designed}. We examine what obstacles exist to applying reflective practices when selecting the \emph{behaviour} of products, and we propose a programme to identify artefacts and processes which can facilitate this work.

\section{Introduction}
% =============================================================================

An inclusive definition of design, offered by Feng and Feenberg [], is "a process of consciously shaping an artifact to adapt it to specific goals and environments". 

However, not all shaping practices adopt the same world-view. Some are close to a scientific method, where choices are \emph{discovered}, deducing them from facts. For example,  a material's physical properties can eliminate it from consideration, or experiments can recommend employing a particular approach over an alternative. Other practices map a space of solutions from which the preferred one will be \emph{decided} based on an explicit or implicit scheme of values and preferences []. 

So, is designing just discovering or decision-making? In this paper, we employ an exclusive definition of design, where the phrase \emph{designed} is reserved for preferences which are arrived at through reflective processes [Schon], where preferences are neither \emph{discovered} through evidence gathering, nor \emph{decided} through systematic analysis of a space of configurations. Instead, a designer engages in a "conversation with materials" [Schon], an operating principle captured well by Ozenc et al's [] phrase, that "the materials [designers] use begin to 'talk back'" [Ozenc et al].

Our position resonates strongly with Fallman's [], that sketching is "the archetypal activity of the design approach". However, if no candidate practices exist to parallel \emph{sketching} when selecting behaviours for a digitally controlled product, and reflective techniques are central to value-creation in all design disciplines, we may ask whether product firmware is in fact designed at all?

We characterise how sketching is employed in other design disciplines, and outline a number of reasons why these approaches cannot be trivially transferred to firmware engineering. We then propose a number of candidates for reflective materials which may be used in firmware design, and articulate the value they could bring.

\section{Sketches and Blueprints}
% =============================================================================
Informal and formal drawings are in use throughout the design process in fashion, architecture and product design, but no analog seems to exist for interactive behaviours. Sketches and blueprints of physical designs capture implementation commitments, guiding and constraining a specialist production process. However, they also stimulate and facilitate engagement with others without demanding they themselves have the skills to materialise the design. By contrast, in a firmware design process, the3 representations which characterise implementation commitments for code are accessible principally to programmers - those skilled in materialising digital behaviours - and can not effectively catalyse knowledge exchange with others. By excluding key stakeholders until working systems are ready to be tested, this restricts the design contributions they can make, and limits the potential for design thinking. In this paper, we explore behaviour blueprints as a design fiction and a rhetorical object. We outline the preferred features by analogy with effective tools from other disciplines, and we detail a program of future co-design experimentation which we hope will allow us to explore and validate candidate representations.

Many participants in a physical design process lack the skills needed to actually materialise the product. Nevertheless, sketches, blueprints and models can serve to catalyse knowledge exchange between a wide range of stakeholders, helping to integrate clients' experience of the market and users' experience of the domain from a very early stage in the design process of a physical product.

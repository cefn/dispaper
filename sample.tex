\begin{abstract}
In the process of realising a product, choices must be made about its configuration. For a digitally-controlled product, its programmed behaviour, or firmware, is an element which will heavily influence user experience. We contrast three caricatures of practice in  which product configurations either \emph{discovered}, \emph{decided} or \emph{designed}, and explore the role of  reflection, sketching and boundary objects as a foundation for the practice of design. On this analysis, established practice for selecting programmed behaviour does not satisfy the criteria for being \emph{designed}. We examine what obstacles exist to applying reflective practices when selecting the \emph{behaviour} of products, and we propose a programme to identify artefacts and processes which can facilitate this work.

\section{Introduction}
% =============================================================================

An inclusive definition of design, offered by Feng and Feenberg [], is "a process of consciously shaping an artifact to adapt it to specific goals and environments". 

However, not all shaping practices adopt the same world-view. Some are close to a scientific method, where choices are \emph{discovered}, deducing them from facts. For example,  a material's physical properties can eliminate it from consideration, or experiments can recommend employing a particular approach over an alternative. Other practices map a space of solutions from which the preferred one will be \emph{decided} based on an explicit or implicit scheme of values and preferences []. 

Is designing just discovering and decision-making? In this paper, we employ an exclusive definition of design, where the phrase \emph{designed} is reserved for preferences which are arrived at through reflective processes [Schon], where preferences are neither \emph{discovered} through evidence gathering, nor \emph{decided} through systematic analysis of a space of configurations. Instead, the designer engages in a "conversation with materials" [Schon], an operating principle captured well by Ozenc et al's [] phrase, that "the materials [designers] use begin to 'talk back'" [Ozenc et al].

Our position resonates strongly with Fallman's [] claim, that sketching is "the archetypal activity of the design approach". We observe that reflective techniques are central to value-creation in all design disciplines. If no candidate practices exist which parallel \emph{sketching} when selecting behaviours for a digitally controlled product, we ask whether product firmware is in fact designed at all? We examine 

Critiques levelled at mainstream interaction design suggest that practice should change.

\section{Sketches and Blueprints}
% =============================================================================
Informal and formal drawings are in use throughout the design process in fashion, architecture and product design, but no analog seems to exist for interactive behaviours. Sketches and blueprints of physical designs capture implementation commitments, guiding and constraining a specialist production process. However, they also stimulate and facilitate engagement with others without demanding they themselves have the skills to materialise the design. By contrast, in a firmware design process, the3 representations which characterise implementation commitments for code are accessible principally to programmers - those skilled in materialising digital behaviours - and can not effectively catalyse knowledge exchange with others. By excluding key stakeholders until working systems are ready to be tested, this restricts the design contributions they can make, and limits the potential for design thinking. In this paper, we explore behaviour blueprints as a design fiction and a rhetorical object. We outline the preferred features by analogy with effective tools from other disciplines, and we detail a program of future co-design experimentation which we hope will allow us to explore and validate candidate representations.

\subsection{Language, style, and content}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. 
Spelling and punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian, US, etc.) provided this is done consistently. 
Hyphenation is optional. 
To ensure suitability for an international audience, please pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}\compresslist
\item   
Write in a straightforward style. 
Use simple sentence structure. 
Try to avoid long sentences and complex sentence structures. 
Use semicolons carefully.
\item   
Use common and basic vocabulary (e.g., use the word ``unusual" rather than the word ``arcane").
\item   
Briefly define or explain all technical terms. 
The terminology common to your practice/discipline may be different in other design practices/disciplines.
\item   
Spell out all acronyms the first time they are used in your text. 
For example, ``World Wide Web (WWW)".
\item   
Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city names in a particular country).
\item   
Explain ``insidecalcr" comments. 
Ensure that your whole audience understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g., do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular application).
\item   
Explain colloquial language and puns. 
Understanding phrases like ``red herring" requires a cultural knowledge of English. 
Humor and irony are difficult to translate.
\item   
Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as times, dates, currencies and numbers (e.g., ``1-5-97" or ``5/1/97" may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock" may mean 7:00 am or 19:00).
\item   
Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she) and other gender-specific words (chairman, manpower, man-months). 
Use inclusive language (e.g., she or he, they, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years) that is gender-neutral. 
If necessary, you may be able to use ``he" and ``she" in alternating sentences, so that the two genders occur equally often~\cite{Schwartz95}. 
\end{itemize}

The examples on this and following pages should help you get a feel for how screen-shots and other figures should be placed in the template. 
Be sure to make images large enough so the important details are legible and clear.

Your document may use color figures, which are included in the page limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black and white.
You can use the \LaTeX's \texttt{marginpar} command to insert figures in the (right) margin side of the document (see \autoref{fig:marginparsample}).

\section{References and Citations}
% =============================================================================
Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets \cite{Anderson92,Klemmer02,Mather00,Zellweger01}
For papers from conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and an abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003 proceedings, use Proc. Interact 2003). 
Do not include the location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page numbers if available. 
See the examples of citations at the end of this document. 

Your references should be published materials accessible to the public.  
Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a nominal fee.  
Proprietary information may not be cited. 
Private communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced  (e.g., [Robertson, personal communication]).

\section{Accessibility}
% =============================================================================
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Add alternative text to all figures
        \item Mark table headings
        \item Add tags to the PDF
        \item Verify the default language
        \item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
Unfortunately good tools do not yet exist to create tagged PDF files from Latex. LaTeX users will need to carry out all of the above steps in the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat, after the PDF has been generated.
 
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please see:
{\url{http://chi2014.acm.org/authors/guide-to-an-accessible-submission}}.

% =============================================================================
\section{Producing and testing PDF files}
% =============================================================================
We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well before the final deadline. 
Besides making sure that you are able to produce a PDF, you will need to check that (a) the length of the file remains within the submission category's page limit, (b) the PDF file size is 4 megabytes or less, and (c) the file can be read and printed using Adobe Acrobat Reader. 
Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 7. 
This is widely available at no cost from~\cite{Acrobat7}.  
Note that most reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat reader, which cannot handle documents containing non-North American or non-European fonts (e.g. Asian fonts).  
Please therefore do not use Asian fonts, and verify this by testing with a North American/European Acrobat reader (obtainable as above). Something as minor as including a space or punctuation character in a two-byte font can render a file unreadable.
